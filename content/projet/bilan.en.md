# Evaluation of the facility

DAs part of its monitoring role, in 2017 – after 6 years of operation – the National Research Agency, which oversees the facility, commissioned a detailed analysis of the practices and results of the project by an independent international jury. The report delivers a broadly positive assessment of the instruments, in particular their success in meeting most of their targets. The report notes : _“One is impressed by the achievements of each of the three components of the DIME project”_. It also concludes _“Overall, the three components of the DIME-SHS project are well on the way of reaching the initial targets of the project. The evaluation of each of these three components of the project is positive.”_

The report nevertheless stresses a major risk, the termination of the main source of funding at the end of 2019, and specifies that the continuance of the project requires that _“the main source of sustainability remains institutional support”_ for the future. Indeed, since it is difficult to imagine a main source of funding other than institutional, the end of these subsidies could threaten the continuity of the services provided by DIME-SHS.


The report also proposes avenues for development and improvement in the final phase of the project. In particular, it emphasises:
-	The need to diversify funding sources,
-	The need to reinforce the scientific impact of the infrastructure,
-	The need to strengthen the project’s international presence.
The two main weaknesses identified by the evaluation jury, however, are the inadequate size of the team relative to its objectives, and the lack of sufficient synergies between the different components of the project.

These recommendations by the international jury resulted in a reassessment of the objectives and priorities of the EquipEx for the final phase of its activities (2018-2019), with the formulation of a [two-year action plan](/docs/CDSP2018-EquipEx-PlanAction-final.pdf)(french only) for this period. It specifies the operational targets (number of surveys, development of applications,…) but also the operations required to enhance the grounding of the DIME-SHS project in the national and European research landscape.
