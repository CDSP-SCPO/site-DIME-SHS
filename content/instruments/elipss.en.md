The DIME-QUANTI instrument, through its ELIPSS (Longitudinal Online Social Science Survey) panel, is a project that produces questionnaire-based surveys for the scientific community. It is based on a random sample of the population resident in Metropolitan France, whose members have been supplied with an Internet connected touchscreen tablet on which to answer monthly surveys.

# Objectives
The purpose of Dime Quanti is to give the scientific community the means to produce data to the highest methodological standards.<br>
Because the Elipss sample is randomly drawn, the academic surveys selected can achieve the benchmark criteria of statistical quality. In addition, the longitudinal nature of the survey is a strong feature, since there exist very few large-scale panel data for social science research.<br>
A secondary objective of the Dime Quanti project is to develop methodological research, in particular by supporting innovative projects and experiments on survey design.
Finally, the documentation and dissemination of the data produced by the project is intended to promote their reuse and therefore to contribute to cumulative research processes.


# Positioning
Elipss is part of an international landscape of online panels intended for the scientific community.<br>
Use of the Internet has developed very quickly in the last 15 years in the field of marketing surveys and opinion polls, mainly because of the low costs and speed of collection possible with the web.<br>
In a report on online surveys (Baker, 2010), AAPOR (American Association for Public Opinion Research) draws attention to the significant biases in online “access” or “opt-in” panels as a way of conducting general population surveys. Although Internet access has grown rapidly since the early 2000s, part of the population is still off-line. In France in 2017, for example, 15% of the population were still without home Internet access. This lack of coverage automatically excludes part of the population from online surveys. Moreover, the use of access or opt-in panels with non-probabilistic samples casts doubt on their representativeness and on the extrapolation of results. <br>
Nonetheless, [the advantages of online surveys](http://quanti.dime-shs.sciences-po.fr/fr/les-origines/) very quickly attracted social science research, in particular as a way to compensate for the drop in response rates in traditional surveys. <br>
In order to overcome the biases flagged by AAPOR, an online panel needs to be constructed using a random sample of the population. This means employing an off-line method of recruitment (face-to-face or by telephone) to include people without Internet access and, if necessary, to provide them with an Internet connection (Das, Ester and Kaczmirek, 2011)[^2]. In consequence, several initiatives emerged in the academic world: the LISS Panel developed by  CentERdata at the University of Tilburg in the Netherlands and the Knowledge Panel in the United States were the first to use probabilistic sampling. France with ELIPSS and Germany with GESIS and GIP followed in 2011 (Blom et al., 2016). Other probabilistic panels designed for research were then set up in Norway, in Sweden, in Iceland, and in the UK.<br>
[The methods used to recruit and include people without Internet access](http://quanti.dime-shs.sciences-po.fr/fr/les-origines/#510) differ between these national schemes. ELIPSS is original in that it gives all the panellists Internet access by supplying them with touchscreen tablets connected to the mobile network. The methodological advantage of this model is that it ensures that all the respondents have the same questionnaire format and that it avoids certain measurement distortions caused by different presentations of the questions.

# Operation
Submitted in response to calls for proposals, the surveys to be distributed to the ELIPSS panel are selected by the DIME-Quanti Scientific and Technical Committee. The ELIPSS team then supports the research teams in the design of the questionnaire and manages the different stages of survey production: scheduling the questionnaire, testing, data collection via the ELIPSS application, field monitoring and reminders, and finally providing the project’s initiators with an exploitable data file.<br>
After a maximum of one year’s exclusive access to the data for the teams that coproduce an ELIPSS survey, the data are added to [the CDSP catalogue](https://cdsp.sciences-po.fr/fr/ressources-en-ligne/?0=subject__libel-ELIPSS) and made available to the whole scientific community.

# Contributions
By giving multiple teams the means to conduct a survey, ELIPSS is able to collect an impressive variety of detailed data, which cast light on the most recent changes in social conditions, practices and attitudes in France in a very large number of spheres.<br>
The richness of these data makes it possible to undertake in-depth analyses of the dynamics running through French society, both because of the very large quantities of individual data collected on the practices, habits and attitudes of the panellists, and because of the longitudinal dimension of some of the surveys, whose questions are repeated several times at regular intervals in order to identify changes in behaviours and opinions at the most granular level.<br>
Beyond the information they provide on French society, the numerous domains explored through the ELIPSS surveys make it possible to explore how this knowledge is constructed and the conditions in which it is produced. In fact, the use of online questionnaires administered to a panel on a touchscreen tablet supplied to the respondents makes it possible both to innovate methodologically, by developing and testing new ways of constructing questions and questionnaires for the general population, and to compare the data produced in this way with those obtained by other survey techniques, in France and in other countries.

#Prospects
The ELIPSS project depends on a variety of skills: online survey design, panel management, or indeed protection of respondent confidentiality.<br>
The aim today is to exploit these different skills to support new research projects.
In future, the project will also need to emphasise the development of methodological research into the improvement of questionnaire-based survey methods.<br>
