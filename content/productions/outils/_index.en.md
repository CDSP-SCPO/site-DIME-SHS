The implementation of the DIME-SHS project required the development of specific digital tools, to perform two roles: as a public interface with the instruments and as operational support for the activities.
All these developments were made to measure by the DIME-SHS teams, though some tools received support from DRIS (Sciences Poâ€™s Resources and Scientific Information Section).
