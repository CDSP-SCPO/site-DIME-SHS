On September 27, on the sidelines of the scientific symposium itself, DIME-SHS’s “public meeting” this year took the new form of a dialogue between the Equipex structures (joint meeting of the scientific board and the Scientific and technical committees of each of the three instruments).

This was an opportunity not only to take stock of the action is already underway and to present the operations planned up to the closure of the project, but also for an open discussion about the prospects for the long-term future of the ELIPSS, beQuali and Dime Web instruments after 2019.

This half day Forum closed with a session dedicated to the experiences of researchers-users of the DIME-SHS instruments - for ELIPSS, Florent Gougou on the Dynamics of Mobilisation (Dynamob) survey and for beQuali, Olivier Rozenberg on the “The French Parliament and the European Union” survey. These presentations both cast light on the essential contributions of the instruments to the practice of research, and on the difficulties that users have experienced, thereby opening lines of thought for the future.


# Achievements and prospects of the instruments

## beQuali
10 surveys already available; 7 additional surveys scheduled by the end of 2019; provision of methodological tools (filing plan, zotéro library, etc.); roll-out of new teaching kits to facilitate reuse by educators.

## ELIPSS
45 datasets already disseminated to the research community; collection and dissemination of some 20 additional datasets by the end of 2019; ongoing preparation of a collective publication dedicated to the ELIPSS experience; active quest for partnerships and development of a new business model to guarantee the continuation of ELIPSS after the end of the Equipex programme.

## Dime web
22 research projects already supported; version 3 of the hyphe crawler made available online (August 2018); prospect of automated rollout in the cloud an introduction of an online payment tool by the end of 2019.
