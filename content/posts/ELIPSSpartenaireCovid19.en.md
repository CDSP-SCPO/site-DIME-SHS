The Sociological Observatory of Change (OSC) and the CDSP are mobilizing to study, through  the prism of social inequalities, the impact of social distancing and the lockdown measures put in place by the government.  Based on the extensive data collected within the framework of the probability-based ELIPSS panel, the "Coping with Covid-19" project will study the evolution of the practices and attitudes of the population by administering a series of surveys specific to Covid-19 during the period of crisis.

# The CoCo Project: Coping with Covid-19

Coordinated by Ettore Recchi (CSO), Coping with Covid-19 / Faire face au Covid-19 (Coco) is a research project aimed at assessing, with regard to social inequalities, the social effects of the epidemic in France. Thanks to an original method-based approach (mixing quantitative longitudinal data, personal diaries, focus groups and individual interviews), CoCo proposes to analyze a wide range of indicators over time (socio-economic, socio-psychological and socio-political), in order to highlight the disruption of daily activities resulting from the rules of the lockdown.

# The ELIPSS contribution

The quantitative part of the project is based on extensive data from the ELIPSS panel, which has been compiled on a regular basis since 2012. From April 2020, five new rounds of surveys will be administered to the ELIPSS panel to cover different phases of the Covid-19 crisis, and to monitor changes in social habits, household structures, life plans, mental health conditions or socio-political attitudes.
This approach will therefore make it possible to systematically record and assess the impact of the epidemic on attitudes and behavior over time.
