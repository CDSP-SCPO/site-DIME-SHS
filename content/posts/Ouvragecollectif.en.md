L'Étude longitudinale par internet pour les sciences sociales (ELIPSS)", a collaborative effort initiated in 2018 with a call for contributions from the data users of the DIME Quanti system, will be published by INED.

Featuring contributions from some thirty authors, the coordinators of the book,

Emmanuelle Duwez and Pierre Mercklé, present the work carried out on twelve datasets produced and disseminated within the framework of ELIPSS. The ambition of this book is twofold: to contribute to knowledge in many areas of social life while questioning the way in which this knowledge is produced.

Three main objectives of the project serve as the outline of the manuscript. Following a chapter that describes how the ELIPSS panel was set up, the first part of the book, entitled "Confronting: data to renew the analysis of the social space", highlights the longitudinal nature of the system and thus the interest of being able to cross-reference a considerable amount of available data. The contributions of the second part, "Comparing: family, justice and health through the prism of different demographics'', focus on the comparability of the data produced in this way. Finally, the last section, "Exploring: new methodologies and new questions'', presents some new surveys that have been created thanks to the ELIPSS panel. 
The book is scheduled for publication in the spring of 2021.
