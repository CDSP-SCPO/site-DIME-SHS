This training, co-financed by the CNRS InSHS, the TGIR PROGEDO, and the MATE-SHS business network, and also supported by the CDSP, mobilized 38 trainees and 13 trainers from October 6th to October 11th. Two members of the beQuali team who were involved in the steering committee of the ANF, were also in charge of the management of four training modules dedicated to reanalysis tools.

Data from the survey [Â« From Africa to France, from one generation to the next" (coordinated by Jacques Barou)](https://doi.org/10.21410/dshs_2016/V2XWWP) and made available by beQuali, served as a guide for choosing the various case studies used in the different workshop sessions, thus putting the Dime-SHS results at the heart of the training.
