The 2018 edition of the International Conference on Web Studies, part of the [Digital Tools & Uses Congress](https://digitaluses-congress.univ-paris8.fr), was held at the MSH Paris in Saint Denis from the 3rd to the 5th of October in 2018. The Dime Web team had been invited by the organizers to present a keynote of its work on hypertext links, and in particular [Hyphe](https://hyphe.medialab.sciences-po.fr), its open source web-crawling software for social sciences.

It was an opportunity for the team to do an in depth review of its approach to web studies in the social sciences, focusing on hyperlinks and web page crawling. As a matter of fact, at a time when a certain number of academics are choosing to abandon this field in favor of the analysis of social networks and their data (which are often much easier to collect through APIs), it would seem appropriate to question the relevance of continuing along this more complex path. Entitled " The Hyperlink is not dead ", the talk ultimately answered this question negatively.

Following a quick historical review of the origins of the web, the hypertext link and the intentions of its creators and users, Dime Web's own approach of exploiting the web as a field of investigation was presented. It was done most notably with the help of Hyphe, and the many original angles of analysis derived from it for analyzing controversies, the community dynamics of polarization between oppositions and affinities, or the effects of hierarchies caused by the directionality of the link, which Robert K. had anticipated as early as the 1960s. Merton and his ["Matthew effect"](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effet_Matthieu).

Since each presentation is accompanied by a publication reviewed and published during the conference, the presentation was also an opportunity to produce a new methodological publication that users of the tool can reference in their work. Published in open access, it is available on [this link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3240431.3240434).

The conference was also an opportunity to meet people who had used Dime Web tools without having solicited help from the team first. For example, Or√©lie Desfriches-Doria has presented the work she and her team had carried out with the help of Hyphe: ["What is Digital Humanities' identity in interdisciplinary practices? An experiment with digital tools for visualizing the francophone DH network"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3240431.3240439). Further evidence of the interest of an Open Science approach in order to maximize the uses and foster the emergence of new research work.
