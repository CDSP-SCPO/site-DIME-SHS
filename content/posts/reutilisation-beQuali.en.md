At Paris Descartes University, some courses in sociology link up with practice. Christophe Giraud, a teacher in sociology of the family, invites his students to confront the use of research survey data already tested, disseminated by beQuali, to test their analytical capacity.

Wanting to intensify the qualitative data analysis - often neglected in favor of collection methods -, Christophe Giraud mobilizes the data corpus of the survey [The formation of couples] (https://bequali.fr/fr/enquetes/lenquete-en-bref/cdsp_bq_s2/) by Michel Bozon and François Héran (1983-85) to train his students.

Processing this corpus as a material to analyze, each student was asked to produce a thematic sheet of an interview of the investigation, following the methods of the anchored theorization, and to develop new results concerning the setting in couple, in particular by the generational comparison.

This pedagogical experience, presented during the 2018 DIME-SHS colloquium, is continuing in 2019 : students divided into groups have the objective of comparing the cases and produce a thesis.
