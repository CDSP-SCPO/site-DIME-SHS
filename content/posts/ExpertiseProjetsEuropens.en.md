The software engineering endeavours supporting the DIME-SHS instruments occasioned valuable skills acquisitions, regarding online panel and device fleet management. This expertise drew the attention of the European Social Survey ([ESS ERIC](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org)) at the time prospecting resources to implement the software infrastructure to support its web panel “Opinion Study for Europe”.


Hence, singled out to partner with the ESS ERIC,  Sciences Po contributes to the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud [SSHOC](https://sshopencloud.eu/) (Social Sciences Humanities Open Cloud) project that endeavours to make accessible through the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) services and resources provided to the SSH scientific community by european research infrastructures. Specifically, the CDSP partakes in the Innovations in data production work package by developing a sample management web service suited to european-scale online surveys. The CDSP is also involved in the first survey project to take advantage of the new infrastructure (ESS-SUSTAIN-2).

An initial  version of the application, covering the functional scope outlined in the first project deliverable, was released in december 2020 with access limited to users in charge of testing during the course of january 2021. The application will consecutively find its first use case in the “Opinion Studies” web survey series covering 12 european countries.

To attend new users, an [online documentation](https://cdsp-scpo.github.io/wpss-doc/) is supplied and will be complemented by a live training session directed  to ESS-SUSTAIN-2 actors, including ESS national coordinators.
