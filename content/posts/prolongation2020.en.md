In September 2019, the DIME-SHS project was granted an additional year to complete the current projects and consolidate the sustainability efforts undertaken in the previous period.

This extension will enable the ELIPSS panel (an operation co-financed by the USPC) to be renewed. It will also guarantee the continuity and quality of the reception given to the panelists most recently integrated into the system, as well as ensuring the transformation of the hyphe application developed by DIME-Web as a "software as a service".

Nevertheless, the year 2019 marks an important milestone as the EquipEx draws to a close. Two events illustrate this: between June and December, nine colleagues finished their fixed-term contracts; in June, the cell phone contract, under which for almost eight years ELIPSS panelists were each provided with a tablet and a 4G subscription to answer online surveys administered by the DIME-Quanti team, also ended.
