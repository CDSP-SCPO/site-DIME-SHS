In order to insure the launch of Equipex, an important wave of recrutement was initiated, from the beginning of the project.

At the end of the pilot phase (2011-2012), 2 developers and 8 engineers dedicated to Quali(2), Quanti (4) and Web (2) instruments joined the initial coordination team, thus bringing DIME-SHS staff number to 16.

Right before the development of Equipex, other recrutements will be made in 2013 and 2014 to guarantee a good expansion of the facilities that were already tested
