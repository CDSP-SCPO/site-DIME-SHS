Initiated in 2011, Equipex DIME-SHS was evaluated by an international and independent jury, which recognized the “impressive” results achieved after 7 years of existence.

EquipEx, which is supposed to come to an end on 2019, has been able to achieve most of its scheduled investments, thus reaching a cruising speed :

1. The BeQuali database now gathers hundreds of interviews
1. A panel of about 3000 people is interviewed every month for the ELIPSS tool, thus forming a catalogue of more than 50 surveys
1. A new version of the Hyphe software was delivered by Dime Web, for an easier installment and higher performance.

At the end of 2017, the teams are fully operating. In addition to the operational coordination hub, 15 engineers funded thanks to the ANR, develop, maintain and make the tools function, alongside permanent staff also working on the project.

For the first two years, in accordance with the 2018-2019 action plan given to the ANR, the efforts will focus on actions that provide value to the data made available since the launch of Equipex (especially with two scientific events scheduled), and on the execution of the elements that can insure a perpetuation of the tools.
