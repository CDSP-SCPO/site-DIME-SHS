After awarding its label in June 2010, and give grant of nearly € 500k in 2015 as part of its action program "Plateformes, infrastructures et équipements de recherche", USPC reiterates its support to the Equipex DIME-SHS at the end of 2018 by a new subsidy of € 86.4k for investments for the future.

Thereby, USPC confirms its recognition of the structuring nature of the instruments made available to the scientific community since the installation of Equipex in 2011.

In addition to other sources of funding, this grant will constitute in 2019 an essential contribution to initiate actions to maintain the existing ELIPSS survey service beyond the Equipex ending.

It will notably be used to co-finance the renewal of the panel's sample, with a view to pursuing the excellence requirement that has characterized the project since its inception.
