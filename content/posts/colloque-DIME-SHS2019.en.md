title:  POSTPONED - DIME-SHS Closing Conference (December 12, 2019)
date:   2019-10-12T00:00:00
---

** Because of the social protest movements and the transport situation, the organising team for the DIME-SHS closing conference has decided to postpone the event to a later date. See you in 2020 to talk about DIME-SHS! **

Implemented as a result of the development plan for the excellence infrastructures, at this year-end 2019, DIME-SHS* turns the page on 10 years of funding for the Equipex programme. A crucial stage in the life-cycle of an infrastructure, the end of funding is not only an opportunity to look back on what has been achieved and to consider the prospects ahead, but also to develop a joint perspective on the role and function of this type of infrastructure in the national and European research landscape. This conference represents that twofold ambition: to tell the story and consider the future of a social science research infrastructure, but also to debate the purpose and funding of this type of experiment.

# December 12th

## 9h-9h30 : accueil café

## 9h30 - 10h30 : ouverture institutionnelle
- Frédéric Mion (Sciences Po)<br/>
- Nicolas Sauger (Sciences Po CDSP, CNRS),<br/>
- Magda Tomasini (Ined).

## 10.45 - 12.15pm : Panel on “the funding of research infrastructures”
The question of finance is often central to the day-to-day preoccupations of research infrastructures. Support for investment, self-funding, institutional partnerships, are all possible and potentially complementary solutions. This round table will look both at the different methods of funding infrastructures, and at their consequences for the activities that those methods are employed to develop. The experience of the DIME-SHS programme and of the quest to maintain it in the future can be a touchstone for these discussions.<br/>
<br/>
**Panel of speakers**<br/>
- Marie d’Arcimoles (Sciences Po CDSP),<br/>
- Fabrice Boudjaaba (CNRS INSHS),<br/>
- Alain Chenu (Sciences Po OSC),<br/>
- Christine Musselin (Sciences Po CSO),<br/>
- Carthage Smith (OCDE).

## 2 - 3.30pm : Round table on “Producing with 4 hands: skills in a research infrastructure”
Infrastructures are a primary meeting point for different skills and roles. The aim of this round table is to explore these encounters, notably in a dialogue between service providers, platform engineers and users. From understanding the project to managing constraints and timetables, the example of DIME-SHS is once again a prism through which to view both the fruitfulness and the difficulties of these encounters and work collaborations.<br/>
<br/>
**Panel of speakers**<br/>
- Damien Cartron (CNRS CMH),<br/>
- Guillaume Garcia (Sciences Po CDSP, CNRS),<br/>
- Anne Gotman (CNRS Cerlis),<br/>
- Agathe Grandval (RNM-GP),<br/>
- Emeline Juillard (Sciences Po CDSP, CNRS),<br/>
- Mathieu Olivier (Sciences Po CDSP, CNRS),<br/>
- Benjamin Ooghe-Tabanou (Sciences Po médialab),<br/>
- Donato Ricci (Sciences Po médialab).

## 4 - 5.30pm : “DIME-SHS Panel: an infrastructure in development”
This panel concludes the day with a more direct discussion of the achievements and prospects of DIME-SHS. How to understand the changes in a project that has been developing for 10 years? What lessons can be learned to build the future of this research infrastructure? It is also an opportunity to think about future needs in terms of social science infrastructure for the coming decade.<br/>
<br/>
**Panel of speakers**<br/>
- Dominique Joye (Université de Lausanne FORS),<br/>
- Nicolas Sauger (Sciences Po CDSP),<br/>
- Roxane Silberman (CNRS CMH),<br/>
- Vincent Tiberj (Sciences Po Bordeaux).
