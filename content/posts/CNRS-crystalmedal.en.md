The CNRS President and the Institute of human and social sciences Director just awarded the [2015 cristal medal ](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr/talents/cnrs?medal=42) to Anne Cornilleau and Anne-Sophie Cousteaux - qualitative teams coordinators at the CDSP - and to Geneviève Michaud - IT team coordinator at the CDSP.

Those medals are a token of appreciation from the CNRS for their commitment and the excellent work they achieved since 2005 at the CDSP, and since 2011 as members of the DIME-SHS Equipex team. Those awards also illustrate the important role engineers, who work side by side with researchers, have in research.
