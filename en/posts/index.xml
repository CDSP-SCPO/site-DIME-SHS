      <title>New important versions of the DIME-web tool</title>
      <link>https://dime-shs.sciencespo.fr/en/posts/releasedimeweb/</link>

      <description>The imminent end of funding for DIME-SHS is an opportunity to finalize a certain number of developments. Some of the developments concerning the Dime Web instrument have been underway for many months on its main open source software, in order to perpetuate the work accomplished and stabilize the tools and their use beyond the lifespan of the Equipex.
Three major new releases have been published in the last few days for Hyphe, Hyphe-Browser and Gazouilloire, and will be presented on February 6, 2021 at the FOSDEM international open source software conference in the Open Research Tools &amp;amp; Technologies room.
The life of these tools does not end with Equipex, and the software will continue to be supported and improved in the future by the engineering team of the médialab at Sciences Po.
Gazouilloire v1.0 Dime Web has developed the Gazouilloire software to allow the implementation of a longitudinal follow-up of Twitter over several months or years. Nearly 7 years after the development of its first prototype and the collection of several hundred million tweets for numerous research projects, Gazouilloire has reached its maturity with its version 1.0!
In addition to being very easy to use for developers with an [installation and configuration that only takes a few minutes, this new version aims, above all, to sustain and stabilize the tool thanks to its upgrade to python3 (the current standard version of the language) and to simplify the handling, exploration and analysis of the large corpuses collected (thanks to the switch to the ElasticSearch data storage and indexing technology).
Hyphe-Browser v2.0 &amp;amp; Hyphe v1.4 Since the release of its first full version in 2017, the web-crawling software for social sciences Hyphe has continued to develop on a regular basis with numerous bug fixes reported by users, but also with the addition of new options, features and settings available with Hyphe v1.4.
As announced in the DIME-SHS 2018 action plan, one of the challenges for Hyphe prior to the end of EquipEx was to facilitate its deployment in order to allow researchers to quickly access the tool, for a more or less short period of time, by making a financial contribution. This objective was achieved thanks to the implementation within Hyphe Browser of the possibility, when choosing the Hyphe server to connect to, of deploying a new server at a cloud host (OVH, CityCloud or VexxHost) at the user&amp;rsquo;s expense in a few clicks, without having to call on the Dime Web team.
The Hyphe Browser complementary software allows users to browse the web while building its corpus with Hyphe; it also allows users to categorize its actors while visiting their web pages. It has been funded by IDEFI FORCCAST in order to train students to use the web in social sciences as part of their controversy analysis courses. In addition to the option of deploying Hyphe instances on the cloud, its brand new version 2.0 has been completely redesigned, after considering the observations of users&amp;rsquo; experiences to make its use much more intuitive. Finally, this redesign has made the tool much more stable and fast, and has enriched it with many new features that will undoubtedly prove very useful for future research projects.</description>

      <guid>https://dime-shs.sciencespo.fr/en/posts/expertiseprojetseuropens/</guid>
      <description>The software engineering endeavours supporting the DIME-SHS instruments occasioned valuable skills acquisitions, regarding online panel and device fleet management. This expertise drew the attention of the European Social Survey (ESS ERIC) at the time prospecting resources to implement the software infrastructure to support its web panel “Opinion Study for Europe”.
Hence, singled out to partner with the ESS ERIC, Sciences Po contributes to the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud SSHOC (Social Sciences Humanities Open Cloud) project that endeavours to make accessible through the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) services and resources provided to the SSH scientific community by european research infrastructures. Specifically, the CDSP partakes in the Innovations in data production work package by developing a sample management web service suited to european-scale online surveys. The CDSP is also involved in the first survey project to take advantage of the new infrastructure (ESS-SUSTAIN-2).
An initial version of the application, covering the functional scope outlined in the first project deliverable, will be released in december 2020 with access limited to users in charge of testing during the course of january 2021. The application will consecutively find its first use case in the “Opinion Studies” web survey series covering 12 european countries.
To attend new users, an online documentation is supplied and will be complemented by a live training session directed to ESS-SUSTAIN-2 actors, including ESS national coordinators.</description>

      <title>POSTPONED - DIME-SHS Closing Conference (December 12, 2019)</title>
      <link>https://dime-shs.sciencespo.fr/en/posts/colloque-dime-shs2019/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;** Because of the social protest movements and the transport situation, the organising team for the DIME-SHS closing conference has decided to postpone the event to a later date. See you in 2020 to talk about DIME-SHS! **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implemented as a result of the development plan for the excellence infrastructures, at this year-end 2019, DIME-SHS* turns the page on 10 years of funding for the Equipex programme. A crucial stage in the life-cycle of an infrastructure, the end of funding is not only an opportunity to look back on what has been achieved and to consider the prospects ahead, but also to develop a joint perspective on the role and function of this type of infrastructure in the national and European research landscape. This conference represents that twofold ambition: to tell the story and consider the future of a social science research infrastructure, but also to debate the purpose and funding of this type of experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After awarding its label in June 2010, and give grant of nearly € 500k in 2015 as part of its action program &amp;ldquo;Plateformes, infrastructures et équipements de recherche&amp;rdquo;, USPC reiterates its support to the Equipex DIME-SHS at the end of 2018 by a new subsidy of € 86.4k for investments for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thereby, USPC confirms its recognition of the structuring nature of the instruments made available to the scientific community since the installation of Equipex in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to other sources of funding, this grant will constitute in 2019 an essential contribution to initiate actions to maintain the existing ELIPSS survey service beyond the Equipex ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will notably be used to co-finance the renewal of the panel&amp;rsquo;s sample, with a view to pursuing the excellence requirement that has characterized the project since its inception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>On September 27, on the sidelines of the scientific symposium itself, DIME-SHS’s “public meeting” this year took the new form of a dialogue between the Equipex structures (joint meeting of the scientific board and the Scientific and technical committees of each of the three instruments).
This was an opportunity not only to take stock of the action is already underway and to present the operations planned up to the closure of the project, but also for an open discussion about the prospects for the long-term future of the ELIPSS, beQuali and Dime Web instruments after 2019.
This half day Forum closed with a session dedicated to the experiences of researchers-users of the DIME-SHS instruments - for ELIPSS, Florent Gougou on the Dynamics of Mobilisation (Dynamob) survey and for beQuali, Olivier Rozenberg on the “The French Parliament and the European Union” survey. These presentations both cast light on the essential contributions of the instruments to the practice of research, and on the difficulties that users have experienced, thereby opening lines of thought for the future.
Achievements and prospects of the instruments beQuali 10 surveys already available; 7 additional surveys scheduled by the end of 2019; provision of methodological tools (filing plan, zotéro library, etc.); roll-out of new teaching kits to facilitate reuse by educators.
ELIPSS 45 datasets already disseminated to the research community; collection and dissemination of some 20 additional datasets by the end of 2019; ongoing preparation of a collective publication dedicated to the ELIPSS experience; active quest for partnerships and development of a new business model to guarantee the continuation of ELIPSS after the end of the Equipex programme.
Dime web 22 research projects already supported; version 3 of the hyphe crawler made available online (August 2018); prospect of automated rollout in the cloud an introduction of an online payment tool by the end of 2019.</description>

      <title>2017 update evaluating the advances from midpoint to the final action programme</title>
      <link>https://dime-shs.sciencespo.fr/en/posts/etape2017/</link>

      <guid>https://dime-shs.sciencespo.fr/en/posts/etape2017/</guid>
      <description>Initiated in 2011, Equipex DIME-SHS was evaluated by an international and independent jury, which recognized the “impressive” results achieved after 7 years of existence.
EquipEx, which is supposed to come to an end on 2019, has been able to achieve most of its scheduled investments, thus reaching a cruising speed :
 The BeQuali database now gathers hundreds of interviews A panel of about 3000 people is interviewed every month for the ELIPSS tool, thus forming a catalogue of more than 50 surveys A new version of the Hyphe software was delivered by Dime Web, for an easier installment and higher performance.  At the end of 2017, the teams are fully operating. In addition to the operational coordination hub, 15 engineers funded thanks to the ANR, develop, maintain and make the tools function, alongside permanent staff also working on the project.
For the first two years, in accordance with the 2018-2019 action plan given to the ANR, the efforts will focus on actions that provide value to the data made available since the launch of Equipex (especially with two scientific events scheduled), and on the execution of the elements that can insure a perpetuation of the tools.</description>
